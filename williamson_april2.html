<h1>Linguère’s Coed Basketball League</h1>

<p>The volunteers in the Department of Linguère in north-central Senegal collaborated to start a monthly coed basketball league for 42 middle school boys and girls from Linguère, Barkedji and Ouarkhokh taking place from December, 2009 through June, 2010.</p>

<p>Originally volunteers targeted basketball as an activity that promotes gender equality, because they had observed that girls and boys consistently play basketball together, which is not true of other popular sports like soccer and wrestling. The volunteers wanted to encourage this positive gender dynamic, to teach technical skills, and to promote teamwork and sportsmanship.</p>

<p>After completing a renovation of the basketball courts at Lycée Alboury Ndiaye in Linguère through a Peace Corps Partnership grant, volunteers collaborated with five local gym teachers to plan and facilitate monthly clinics in Linguère on Sunday mornings over the course of six months.</p>

<p>The first clinics focused on simple skills like dribbling and passing, along with very basic rules of the game, because many of the participants had never played basketball before. As the participants improved their skills and gained confidence, they formed teams that eventually competed against each other in an end of the school year tournament held in June, 2010.</p>

<p>The project was very successful for a number of reasons. The participants’ skills visibly improved over the six months. The male and female students enjoyed playing together and treated each other with respect. The students also had a lot of fun socializing with new friends from different schools, dancing to music between drills, and drinking cold juice after a long, hot practice.</p>

<p>Additionally, the collaboration between American volunteers and Senegalese partners was successful and sustainable, because as the project progressed, the Senegalese gym teachers took more responsibility for the planning and implementation of the projects. They will be able to facilitate similar basketball activities for boys and girls in future years, even without the involvement of Peace Corps volunteers.</p>
