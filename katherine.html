<h1>Katherine Onyshko's Girls' Group, Bambey</h1>
<p>The Bambey girls' group is the three best students from each class, and occasionally some of their friends. The group started with Michelle Sylvester winners but has expanded beyond the scholarship. Meeting twice a month formally, the girls have already studied the basics of business as well as discussed their future. Informal meetings occur more regularly and range from just hanging out to creative activities such as painting a mural at their middle school. They are currently planning a career day when the girls will shadow a professional in a career that interests them as well as discuss steps to entering the professional world. Most of the girls do not travel during the break from school and they plan to have miniature theater, basketball, and English camps. The success of the girls' group isn't in keeping them busy, but in allowing them to be creative and try things that are typically 'not' for girls. We're building a small community of achievement oriented girls to provide support for each other as they pursue the dreams they're exploring now.
