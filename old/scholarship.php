                 The Michele Sylvester Memorial Scholarship Fund was founded in 1993 in memory
                 of Peace Corps Volunteer Michele Sylvester whose life was abruptly ended in
                 an automobile accident. Michele was committed to girls' education in Senegal.
                 Initially, the scholarship was designed to benefit two village-based girls,
                 but thanks to friends and families of Peace Corps Senegal, the number of
                 recipients has grown in recent years. For the 2005-2006 school year, SeneGAD
                 awarded 28 scholarships in the regions of Dakar, Matam, Kolda, Tambacounda,
                 Kedegou, Kaolack, to girls at the middle school level.  Scholarships are
                 awarded based on the girls' GPA, motivation, need, and location. Each girl
                 receives a grant of 25,000 CFA (app. US$ 50) to help with inscription fees
                 and school supplies. Many recipients of the Michele Sylvester scholarship are
                 partnered with a PCV who becomes a mentor and friend and follows the girl's
                 progress throughout the school term.
