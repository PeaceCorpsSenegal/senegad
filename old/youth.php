                 	 SeneGAD currently funds Youth Clubs across Senegal.  SeneGAD currently 
                 	 funds clubs bi-annually; the number of clubs varies according to how much 
                 	 money is available.  Each Youth Club can receive up to 50,000 CFA (app. US $100) 
                 	 to fund activities. Application deadlines are at the end of May and October.  
                 	 Youth Club activities vary depending on location, participation, and leadership. 
                 	 In Kedegou, a volunteer facilitated a club with 15-18 year old young girls where 
                 	 they discussed issues such as self-esteem, goal setting, female role models, 
                 	 HIV/AIDS, family planning, female health, and the importance of education for 
                 	 women.  In Podor, PCVs organized a girls leadership conference with the MS 
                 	 Scholarship recipients and other village girls. Most Girls' Club activities 
                 	 are initiated by PCVs and facilitated by host country nationals.
