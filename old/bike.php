				 "Tour des Femmes" is a seven day cycling campaign that highlights a specific
				 theme relating to women. The 2002 bike tour promoted girls'	 education, while
				 the 2003 bike tour focused on health education for women, emphasizing the role
				 that education plays in reproductive health and the health of the entire
				 family. A select group of Senegalese women, accompanied by PCVs, traveled
				 the 250 km length of the tour as both the tour's moving billboard and as a
				 testament to women's strength and independence. "Tour des Femmes" was
				 organized by PCVs and funded through US AID, TOSTAN, SCOFI, and FHI.

				 PCVs in the region of Matam recruited 7 middle school aged girls
				 to participate in a three day bike tour through five village.  This
				 "Fouta Bike Tour" promoted the importance of educating girls tin order
				 for them to become healthier women.  Peace Corps collaborated with TOSTAN,
				 a local NGO, and regional health officials to disseminate information about
				 the importance of women's health and girl's education. PCVs held a training
				 for the particpating girls, facilitated by a local health worker knowledgeable
				 in "Life Skills," about the importance of positive decision-making and
				 education to their health.  The purpose of this training was to prepare
				 the girls to speak publicly in each villlage along the tour. The girls also
				 learned about road safety and bike maintenance.  Additionally, five midwives
				 and fifteen village health workers were trained in maternal health and HIV/AIDS
				 prevention.
