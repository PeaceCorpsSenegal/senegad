                 <b>&quot;Women in the Workplace&quot;</b> by Barry Pousman, PCV Senegal<br><br>
                 &quot;Women in the Workplace&quot; is a documentary focusing on several success stories of
                 women from all over Senegal.  Each of these women come from different backgrounds
                 and have taken different paths to get where they are today.  Some of them come from
                 small villages while others come from relatively more urban environments, some
                 from supportive families and others from less supportive families.  But each of
                 these women realized at some point in their lives that they could do more.
                 All too often, many women are pressured into lives that limit their potential,
                 negatively affecting both their individual selves and greater society.
                 This documentary looks at the histories of these women, the steps they have
                 taken in pursuit of their goals, the feelings they now have about their work,
                 and their hopes for the future.
               </p>
               <p class=content_text>
                 &quot;Women in the Workplace&quot; will be distributed to High Schools throughout
                 Senegal to facilitate discussions on the role of women in Senegalese society.
                 There will also be public screenings in Dakar at the French Cultural Institute and
                 copies will be given to various national NGO's for their outreach reference libraries.
                 The goal of this project is to continue the dialogue already in progress in Senegal
                 on women in the workplace.  And through SeneGAD (Senegal Gender and Development),
                 a secondary project for many Peace Corps Senegal Volunteers, this film will hopefully
                 be able to permeate local communities encouraging sustainable change in gender
                 perspectives for Senegalese society at large.  There are millions of women in Senegal;
                 lets help them reach their full potential.
               </p>
               <p class=content_text>
                 <b>Note from Kim Rusnak:</b><br>
				 Barry and Annie are here in Dakar working on a SeneGAD Video Project.  They will be
				 interviewing Senegalese women, and putting together a video - the idea behind it being
				 that we will have a video resource of interesting, career-minded women, who have come
				 from villages and done something interesting and unique with their lives.  This will
				 be translated, inchallah, into local languages and available for volunteers to use for
				 youth clubs, youth camps, etc.
			   </p>
			   <p class=content_text>
				 One of the ideas to go along with this was, to have some pictures, that are drawn by
				 youth throughout Senegal, about women.  They could potentially be used in the
				 introduction of the film, or the credits.  We would like the children is draw about
				 women, how they view women, what they think of when you say "women" or "gender".
				 They can be color or black & white.  They could be more from anything, paint, crayons,
				 charcoal, recycled products, etc.  Be Creative!!!

                 SeneGAD began in the early 1980’s as a secondary project of Peace Corps
                 volunteers, under the name WID (Women in Development). The original mission
                 and philosophy have changed slightly. The current GAD approach focuses on the
                 social, economic, political and culturalforces that determine how men and
                 women participate in, benefit from and control project resources and activities
                 differently.
