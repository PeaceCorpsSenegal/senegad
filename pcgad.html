						<h1>In-Sector Gender and Development Work: How Volunteers incorporate Gender work in their Peace Corps projects</h1>



<h3>Agriculture</h3>
<p><img src="photo/photo_ag.jpg" border="0" id="floatleft" />For agriculture volunteers Gender and Development (GAD) work is interwoven into much of what they do. Many work with women's groups gardens, helping them to improve the quality and quantity of what they grow. This not only helps them feed their families, but also allows them to earn their own independent income. Agriculture volunteers also work with school gardens, teaching the youth of our communities about growing their own food. They encourage their girls' and youth groups to think about the future  Much of their gardening and farming will help to feed the their communities. Traditionally, men have done most of the farming in Senegal. Agriculture volunteers encourage women to start gardening and farming, and encourage those that already do to expand and improve their gardens and fields.  Peace Corps Agriculture volunteers extend field crop seeds to many farmer, some of whom are women. This not only aids women and their families, but allows us to educate men and encourages the breakdown of gender stereotypes. Empowering women and children to grow more food enhances their nutrition, health, economic independence, and benefits everyone in the community.</p>


<h3>Small Enterprise Development (SED)</h3>
<p><img src="photo/photo_sed.jpg" border="0" id="floatright" />The Small Enterprise Development (SED) program in Peace Corps Senegal strives to promote individual and group initiatives within the realm of entrepreneurship and business. The overarching goal of the SED program is for the volunteer to act as a catalyst for the growth of sustainable, entrepreneurial activities. This can be done through hands-on business training, one-on-one consultations and group trainings that cover topics such as basic business skills, information technology, and tapping into local or national resources. Without a doubt, SED work and Gender and Development work go hand-in-hand.  Through training and education, SED volunteers can teach girls and women important business practices and help them reach their entrepreneurial goals. This, in turn, can lead to successful income generating activities for girls and women that can give them financial stability and independence.  Because SED volunteers can teach or assist groups of both men and women, even simultaneously in the same subject matter, it sends a message to the community that women and men can be on the same playing field.  See example </p>


<h3>Health/Environmental Education (EE)</h3>
<p><img src="photo/photo_health.jpg" border="0" class="floatright" />Health Education and Environmental Education volunteers in Senegal do a variety of gender and development work.  The goal of Health/EE goal is to incorporate the promotion of female education, health, and success in the communities in the work they do.  Currently volunteers are working on reproductive health education, prenatal/maternal health education, Girls' Clubs in the high schools and middle schools, Michele Sylvester Scholarships at the middle schools, and women's gardens.</p>
