							<h1>VAST Success</h1>
							<p><img src="photo/0001_w300.jpg" class="floatleft">The Koun Kane girl's leadership conference was a two-day seminar for sixty 6th grade girls including the 9 Michelle Sylvester scholarship candidates. The goal of this project was to teach middle school girls leadership and decision-making skills in order to empower them to further pursue their education, prevent HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, and avoid teen pregnancy. The goal also aimed at increasing communication between the girls and their parents. The intention of the conference was to equip girls with the knowledge and tools to be successful.</p>

							<p>The conference was the first of its kind and ended up being a great success.  We had a phenomenal turnout of both girls and their parents. This enabled our planning and predictions to be carried out efficiently. Awa Traore did an excellent job at facilitating the entire conference and our 5 panelists played an intricate role in sharing their knowledge and life experiences.</p>

							<p>We were able to create an intimate environment where each girl was able to discuss their future endeavors and create practical action plans. They were then challenged to look at different obstacles that could potentially prevent them form achieving such ambitions. Most of these sessions dealt with sexual peer pressure and the risks involved. Our local matron explained the consequences of unprotected intercourse and was able to provide answers to many of the frequent questions that many times go un-asked. This session proved to be empowering because the girls learned about making smart decisions while learning the importance of being in control of their bodies.</p>

							<p><img src="photo/0002_w300.jpg" class="floatright">We had an interactive session with the girls and their parents where Awa led a discussion about how to support their daughters. She brought up culturally sensitive issues and challenged parents to play a stronger role in encouraging their daughter's education and protecting them from things such as early pregnancy, forced marriage, HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.  She also talked about rape and sexual abuse that often happens inside the compound.  This session was extremely successful and ended with the presentation of certificates where the village chief, Awa, and the government elected official presented them to the participants.  It was a way to verbally recognize the girls in front of their community and show that there education and choices are important to improving the society of Koun Kane.</p>

<p>Due to the overwhelming success of this girl's conference it can be concluded that the VAST funding went to an excellent cause.  It not only allowed volunteers to educate about HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, but it played a distinct role in empowering 56 teenage girls to take control of their lives, plan their futures, and inspire them to make a difference.  This conference surly changed the perspective of minds, not only in the youth, but amongst adults as well. The communities' response leads us to believe that such an event could be an annual occurrence.</p>
