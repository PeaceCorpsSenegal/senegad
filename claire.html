<h1>Claire's IT Class</h1><a href="/photo/28725_666830359842_39100438_36752265_644597_n.jpg"><img src="/photo/28725_666830359842_39100438_36752265_644597_n_250.jpg" id="floatright" /></a>
<p>Claire Brittain works with the Louga chapter of SCOFI (Scolarisation des Filles/Education for Girls), a national organization of women educators who volunteer their efforts to keep girls in school and out of early marriages. She was impressed by their dedication and personal involvement in the community.  Many of the women dedicated their <a href="/photo/unacceptable.jpg"><img src="/photo/unacceptable_200.jpg" id="floatleft" /></a>limited time and money to participate.
  Working with the SCOFI, she analyzed the needs of the organization and the students they support. Computer skills are the top priority.</p>
 
<p>This work empowers women and girls. She found a group who are really excited to learn how to create a table of information, or even just properly select a section of text in a document. They know the value of computer skills and will be able to use to directly improve their lives and the lives of the girls they support.</p>

<p>Claire successfully raised $560 through a Peace Corps Partnership Proposal for 10 used P3 and P4s at a cost of $56 per computer. In addition, SCOFI contributed over 400,000 CFA ($800).  An unused classroom at a primary school was donated and transformed into a computer lab. SCOFI created a second door on the classroom for better airflow, purchased tables and chairs, curtains, computer coverings, flooring, extension cords, 2 mounted wall fans, and other miscellaneous necessities.</p>
<p>Claire currently teaches ten SCOFI members basic computer skills. They meet every Monday, Wednesday and Friday afternoon. The women come on time and stay late - proof of the need for these skills.</p>

<p>They started by learning about the evolution of computers, what hard drive, mouse, screen and desktop actually mean and how they function. After learning how to turn the computer on and off, they delve into the keyboard using "TypingMaster Pro" as a starting point. Interchangeable between English and French, it guides users through proper typing techniques by explanation and exercises.</p>
<p><a href="/photo/Claire and Student.jpg"><img src="/photo/Claire and Student_250.jpg"  id="floatleft" /></a>The women are learning incredibly fast! She teaches how to create all kinds of documents- lists, tables, meeting summaries, forms, invitations, etc. Once they learn everything they need to know in Microsoft Office, she plans to teach them Best Grade, a program created by RPCVs for Senegalese schools for keeping grades.</p>

<p>9 PCVs supporting 11 local partnering groups received computers through World Computer Exchange (WCE). "World Computer Exchange is a global education & environment nonprofit that helps connect youth in 67 developing countries to the skills, opportunities & understanding of the Internet while keeping working computers out of landfills" (<a href="http://worldcomputerexchange.org/about-us" target="_blank">worldcomputerexchange.org/about-us</a>).</p></td></tr>
