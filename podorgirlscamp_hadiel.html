								<h1>Podor Girls Camp Summer 2011</h1>
	  
								<p><a href="photo/podorgc_h3.jpg"><img src="photo/podorgc_h3.jpg" height="250" class="floatright" /></a><b>Summary</b>
								In Senegal, Peace Corps volunteers witness the daily struggles female students have to continue their education. In reaction to these inequalities volunteers in the Podor Department, in collaboration with the NGO Tostan, assembled a week-long Girls’ Leadership Camp to honor high achieving students for their hard work and dedication. The camp’s primary focus was to instill leadership skills and decision-making strategies into the girls, as well as the importance of continuing education.</p>
								<p><b>Context</b>
								The inequalities female students face make it challenging for the girls to have the motivation to continue their schooling, and places the girls in dilemmas of forced or early marriages. With the high emphasis of 
								gender roles in Senegal girls are expected to be responsible for household work in addition to their schoolwork, which increases the workload for the girls, often double that of their male peers.</p> 

								<p>To address these issues Volunteers in the Podor Department held a camp consisting of twenty-nine participating girls, from the following villages and towns: Ndioum, Taredji, Diambo Soubalo, Aram, Medina Ndiathbe, Bocke Sal Salbe, Bocke Dialloube. The girls were the top of their classes ranging from CMII to 6eme; including six 5eme and 4eme MSS winners from 2010 acting as junior camp counselors.</p>

								<p>The camp was designed to teach the girls technical skills, career planning, and life skills; as well as creating a safe, friendly environment to celebrate the girls for their academic achievement. The volunteers served as instructors, alongside Junior Camp Counselors, assisting with lessons, camp activities, and acting as mentors for the participants.</p>
								
								<p><b>Approach</b>
								Seven volunteers from the Podor Department chose two to four female participants from their site, or villages in proximity. In addition to the 23 female participants, six 5eme and 4eme girls acted as Junior Camp Counselors, providing the volunteers assistance with lessons and managing the participants. The Junior Camp Counselors acted as positive role models for the younger participants, strengthing the leadership skills of all counselors.  The Junior Camp Counselors served as a resource and reference for the girls since they understood the cultural and societal issues that the girls were facing better than the volunteers whereas the volunteers were able to provide a new and fresh perspective.</p>

								 <p>The volunteers partnered with the NGO Tostan, located in Ndioum, Tostan provided free lodging and use of its facilities, including a classroom for all the trainings. The rest of the costs for the materials, food, and various expenses were funded by a VAST grant.</p>

								<p>The curriculum varied to cover topics including: environmental issues, nutrition, hygiene care, HIV/AIDS, STIs, life skills, arts and crafts, culture, and guest speakers. Guest speakers presented the right to education, their careers, and personal health issues creating an open environment for the girls to ask questions. Lessons covered a wide range of topics specific to the participants’ lives, including Moringa nutrition, trash management, Neem lotion, sports, food from around the world, the Pulaar alphabet, a career panel, self value, HIV/AIDS, self esteem, small development projects, and goal planning. At the end of the camp the girls were proud to show their parent’s the work they accomplished, and the lessons they learned during camp.</p>
								
								<p>Tidiane Diao, Peace Corps Northern Regional Volunteer Support Assistant gave a presentation for the parents and participants on “Graduation Day”. The presentation discussed the importance of continuing school, the parent’s roles in encouraging the girls, and the difficulties girls’ face in their lives (for example, forced marriages).</p>
								
								<p><b>Results</b>
								The participants were proud of the work they accomplished during the week especially as they presented their work to their parents on “Graduation Day.” The girls created community development projects to implement in their own communities after the girls’ camp. They presented these projects to their parents. The girls’ showed excitement to actualize their planned projects in their communities. The girls were appreciative of the camp, especially in encouraging them to continue to work hard in school. At the end of the camp the girls were anxious to tell their friends and communities about the things they learned and to share their experiences they had which will further spread the knowledge.</p>

								<p>The Junior Camp Counselors also benefitted greatly from the camp. They were given positions of leadership and achieved greatly, further empowering the girls. The girls now have a better sense of connection between themselves and younger classmates, boosting their self esteem about their roles in the school environment and their ability as mentors and community leaders.</p>

								<p><b>Next Steps</b>
								Camp participants will be encouraged to apply their skills in their communities. Participants are in close proximity to the volunteers, allowing their participants to continue their communication with their volunteers for support and guidance. The participants developed a community project to implement in their communities, the volunteers can act as a resource and give the girls assistance with the development of their project. Volunteers will continue the conversations/education through follow-up work with the girls, such work will happen over the course of the volunteers’ services.</p>
