<h1>April’s Girls’ Group</h1>

<p>In 2009, PCV April Williamson started an informal girls’ group for six middle school girls in the village of Barkedji, located in the Department of Linguère in north-central Senegal.</p>

<p>To create an open, safe environment away from school for the girls to discuss their hopes and dreams, as well as challenges they face in their day-to-day lives, April facilitated bi-weekly meetings at her house. Girls sat on mattresses and enjoyed snacks and drinks as they participated in activities and discussions.</p>

<p>Each meeting began with a fun game like Uno or Shoulders, followed by a life skills activity such as the creation of “About Me” collages and a group concept map about the value of girls’ education. Then the girls watched and discussed videos from the Scenarios in Africa HIV/AIDS film series selected to correspond with themes such as “HIV/AIDS in Schools” and “The Condom as a Method of Prevention.” After each film, the girls drew on their experiences to discuss how the film’s concepts related to their own lives and how they could use their new knowledge to make good decisions every day.</p>

<p>The girls consistently looked forward to meetings, because the informal nature of the group allowed them to have fun and express their individuality in a way they otherwise wouldn’t. Not only did the group provide them a nice break from school- and house-work, it also increased their knowledge of HIV/AIDS prevention and gave them an important opportunity for individual reflection and expression.</p>
